# About Me
![](images/headshot.jpg){width="150" style="float:right; margin-left:1rem; border-radius:8px;"}

I am currently pursuing an **MBA (2024 – 2025) at University Canada West** with a background that bridges accounting and large-scale construction supervision.  
Over 11 years I have managed corporate ledgers, payroll, and compliance as an *Accountant*, and later led rural road-building projects as a *Construction Supervisor*.  
This dual experience gives me a unique perspective on budgeting, operations, and field execution.  
I’m passionate about using data-driven insights and emerging technologies—especially **Generative AI and digital marketing**—to deliver projects that improve lives in underserved communities.
