# Planning and Research

**Objective**  
To build a clear, multi-page MBA portfolio that showcases my background, highlights key certifications, and guides a recruiter smoothly from overview to detail.

## Key Insights from Research

1. **Section Structure**  
   Recruiters scan in this order:  
   - About Me → Education → Experience → Certifications → Skills → Contact  
   Sticking to that order makes the site intuitive.

2. **Design & Accessibility**  
   - Single-column layout on mobile, two-column on desktop  
   - High contrast (dark text on white) for readability  
   - Alt text on all images for screen-readers

3. **Interactive Elements**  
   Rather than static lists, I chose interactive modals (for certificates) to keep the main pages focused and uncluttered.

## My Unique Content to Showcase

- **MBA (2024–2025)** at University Canada West—ongoing  
- **11 years** bridging Accounting (financial reporting, auditing) and Construction Supervision (rural road projects)  
- **Certifications** in Generative AI (Microsoft × LinkedIn) & Digital Marketing (DMI × AMA)  
- **Core strengths**: budgeting, team leadership, data-driven decision making

## Technology & Workflow

- **Quarto** for Markdown → HTML and multi-page site  
- **Bootstrap “cosmo” theme** with light custom CSS  
- **Git + GitHub Pages** for version control and deployment  
- **ChatGPT-4o** for initial brainstorming (raw output in LLM Draft page)  

This plan ensured each assignment requirement maps to a clear page or section, and that I could track my process end-to-end.
